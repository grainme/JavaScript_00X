## Notes
- The benefit of a seperate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its cache.
- Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
- That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

Web Cache or HTTP cache is a system for optimizing the World Wide Web.
