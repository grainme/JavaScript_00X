# JavaScript README 🚀

## What is JavaScript? 🤔

JavaScript (JS) was initially created to make web pages "alive." Programs written in this language are called scripts, and they can be written directly within an HTML web page. These scripts are executed automatically as the page loads, without the need for special preparation or compilation.

JavaScript can be executed not only in the browser but also on the server or any device that has a JS engine. The browser typically has an embedded JS engine, also known as a "JS Virtual Machine." Different browsers use different engines, such as:

- V8: Used in Chrome, Opera, and Edge 🌐
- SpiderMonkey: Used in Firefox 🦊

A JS engine is a software component that executes JS code. While the first JS engines were interpreters, modern engines use Just-In-Time Compilation to improve performance.

## Interpreters vs. Compilers 📚

An interpreter takes a single line of code at a time and executes it, while a compiler takes the entire program and compiles it into machine code before execution. Unlike compilers, interpreters do not produce any intermediate machine code.

## What Makes JS Unique? 🌟

JavaScript offers several unique features and advantages, including:

- Full integration with HTML/CSS 🎨
- Simplicity in handling simple tasks ✨
- Support from all major browsers and enabled by default 🌐
