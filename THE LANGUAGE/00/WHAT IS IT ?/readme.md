What is JavaScript?
JS was initially created to make web page "alive".
The program in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts don't need special preparation or compilation to run.
JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server or actually on any device that has a special program called the JS engine.
The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JS Virtual Machine".
Different engines have different codenames. for example:
-> V8 - in Chrome, Opera and Edge
-> SpiderMonkey - in Firefox
PS : JavaScript Engine is a software component that executes JS code.
Emmm what does that mean?
So a JS Engine is a software component that executes JS code. The first JS engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use Just-In-Time Compilation for improved performance.
But also what is Interpreters, and what differ them from compilers?
A compiler takes the entire program in one go, an interpreter though takes a single line of code at a time && also the interpreter never produces any intermediate machine code.
