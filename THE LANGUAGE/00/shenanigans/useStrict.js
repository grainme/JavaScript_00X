// The "use strict" directive enables JavaScript's strict mode. JavaScript's strict mode was introduced
// in ECMAScript 5. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling on the code at runtime.
// It also helps you write cleaner code and catch errors and bugs that might otherwise go unnoticed.

}
